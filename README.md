# Simulation of Sampling, Filtering, and Frequency Analysis of Audio Signals

This repository contains the complete Python-based implementation of a **Signals and Systems** academic project.  
The project demonstrates important theoretical concepts such as **Nyquist Sampling Theorem**, **aliasing**, **anti-aliasing filtering**, **FIR and IIR filter design**, **convolution**, and **speech signal frequency analysis** using real audio signals.
